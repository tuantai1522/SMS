# SMS Frontend (Vite + React)

This is a fresh React + TypeScript app (Vite) intended to become the new frontend for SMS.

## Requirements

- Node.js + npm

## Run

From `D:\RepositoryGithub\SMS\frontend`:

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`

## Environment variables

Copy the template file and adjust for your backend:

- Copy `./.env.example` to `./.env.local`
- Set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to your backend base URL (e.g. `https://localhost:5001`)

Optional:

- `VITE_API_PROBE_PATH` (default: `/swagger/v1/swagger.json`) used by the Home page “API connection” probe.

## Routing (TanStack Router)

- File-based routes live under `src/routes/`.
- Route tree is generated into `src/routeTree.gen.ts` (do not edit this file manually).
- The root layout is `src/routes/__root.tsx`.

## Data fetching (TanStack Query)

- The app creates a shared QueryClient in `src/shared/lib/queryClient.ts`.
- Global query errors are currently logged; 401/403 are detected and logged (no redirects yet).

## Theming

- Theme mode: `light | dark | system`
- Storage key: `sms.theme` (localStorage)
- Applied to the document by:
  - toggling the `dark` class (Tailwind `dark:` variants)
  - setting `data-theme="light|dark|system"`
- Default theme on first visit: **Light**

Early theme application is done in `index.html` to reduce flash before React mounts.

## UI

- Theme switcher is in the top navigation (`src/routes/__root.tsx`).
